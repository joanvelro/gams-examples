    Unique element expected - symbol was not an element
       and the following text will be skipped until a proper
       symbol is found to recover. Remember that an UNQUOTED
       element has to start with a letter or digit
       followed by letters, digits, '+', '-' or '_'. The length
       is limited to 63 characters. The following words are
       reserved (starting symbols of a GAMS statement) and cannot
       be used for UNQUOTED set elements:
